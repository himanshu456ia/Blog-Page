      "Google has agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action lawsuit that alleges the company underpaid female employees. The agreement will release Google from claims that it paid women in Covered Positions less than it paid men for substantially similar work, that Google assigned women to lower levels than it assigned men, and that Google failed to pay all wages due to employees upon their separation of employment the settlement says.The settlement covers about 15,500 women who have worked for Google in California since 2013, the plaintiffs' law firm said in an announcement on Saturday. Four named plaintiffs will get separate payouts: $75,000 for lead plaintiff Kelly Ellis and $50,000 each for the other three, in addition to their regular share from the net settlement fund. The settlement class covers a wide range of workers with 236 job titles.",

      "In August 1917, a World War I British soldier named John Glubb was hit in the face by a shell. He recalled blood pouring out in torrents and feeling something akin to a chicken bone moving around his left cheek. It turned out to be half of his jaw, broken off by the impact.Glubb wasn't the only unfortunate WWI soldier to suffer a disfiguring facial injury. Shells filled with shrapnel were designed to inflict as much damage as possible, and the need to peer over the parapets of trenches to assess the battlefield or fire a shot meant a greater risk of getting hit in the face by bits of flying metal. Unlike losing a limb, these soldiers faced great social and professional stigmas when they returned home from the front because of their disfigurement. They were usually reduced to taking night shifts and relegated to special blue benches when out in public—a warning to others to avert their eyes.",

     "On Sunday, the launch of two CubeSats on an Astra rocket failed to go as planned, with the rocket's second stage cutting out prematurely. The loss cost NASA two CubeSats that were meant to be part of a small constellation that would track the development of tropical storms. The failure represents yet another setback for a rocket company that has emphasized rapid development and testing-by-launching.The lost CubeSats were intended to be part of a six-satellite series called TROPICS. With six satellites in three different orbital planes, TROPICS was designed to provide detailed temporal and spatial imaging of precipitation in tropical storms. NASA's statement on the loss indicates that the agency will still be able to pursue the mission with just four satellites.",

      "Major cryptocurrencies suffered big losses on Monday. As I write this, bitcoin is down 14 percent over the last 24 hours, while ether is down 16 percent. Other major cryptocurrencies—including solana, dogecoin, and litecoin—are also down by double digits, according to CoinMarketCap.The cryptocurrency crash is part of a broader market sell-off. The S&P 500 stock market index fell almost 4 percent on Monday amid fears of faster interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. High interest rates put downward pressure on all assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.",

     "Development of a Meta smartwatch is on pause, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing an anonymous person with knowledge of the matter.Facebook's parent company never confirmed it was making a smartwatch to rival the Apple Watch and Samsung's Galaxy Watch. It also declined to comment on Bloomberg's story. However, Bloomberg claimed that Meta has been working on a smartwatch, codenamed Milan, for at least two years.Bloomberg claims to have seen images and video of a Meta watch prototype that featured two cameras to compete with the Apple Watch's zero. That dual-camera design—which purportedly included one 5MP camera south of the watch face and a 12MP one on the face's backside facing the wearer's arm—was apparently part of the problem, however.",

     "Apple's Studio Display, a 27-inch 5K IPS panel that offers USB-C connectivity, a polished finish, and some Apple-style perks, is a solid display. But what if you're a Mac owner who doesn't need 5K, or what if you don't want to spend $1,600 on a monitor? What if you need to work across operating systems and want a stylish display with a unique boost in image quality?Enter the Dell UltraSharp U2723QE ($655 MSRP as of writing). Dell's USB-C-equipped UltraSharp line is a popular option for Mac and Windows users, though the U2723QE comes at a premium over other displays in the lineup because it introduces LG Display's IPS Black technology, which aims to deliver twice as much contrast as the average IPS screen. You might not be able to tell 5K from 4K, but it's easy to see the rich contrast the U2723QE delivers over standard IPS monitors, including the Studio Display.",
